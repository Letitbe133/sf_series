    <h1>Symfony Series #1</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>The file structure</h2>
      <p>
        There are 4 main directories in Symfony that we need to care about :
      </p>
      <h3>/config</h3>
      <p>
        In this directory will live all the config files necessary to run your
        app
      </p>
      <p>Inside you will find a <b>routes.yaml</b> file. Take a look inside</p>
      <h3>/public</h3>
      <p>This is the only public entry point to your app.</p>
      <p>
        Inside it will live all the files and assets that need to be accessed by
        the browser
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Images and medias
        </li>
        <li>
          Stylesheets
        </li>
        <li>
          Js scripts
        </li>
        <li>
          And an index.php page that will be the <b>Front Controller</b> of your
          app
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <b>Front Controller</b> will intercept all the requests made to your
        app
      </p>
      <h3>/src</h3>
      <p>This is your working directory, where you will write your PHP code</p>
      <p>Inside you will find several directories, amongst them :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          /src/Controller : which will contain your <b>controllers</b> classes
        </li>
        <li>
          /src/Entity : which will contain your <b>entities</b>. Remember that
          entities are classes that will be used by Symfony to create tables in
          your database
        </li>
        <li>
          /src/Migrations : which will contain the files that keep track of the
          migrations (or modifications) to the structure of your tables
        </li>
        <li>
          /src/Repository : which will contain the
          <b>repositories</b> corresponding to your <b>entities</b>. <br />A
          <b>repository</b>is a class that will help you query your tables and
          make <b>SELECT</b> requests
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>/templates</h3>
      <p>
        In this directory will live all the templates (or pages for your app)
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The routing</h2>
      <h3>How does it work ?</h3>
      <h4>Step #1</h4>
      <p>
        The <b>Front Controller</b> of your app will intercept all incoming
        <b>requests</b> (ex /home, /about, /contact, /wtf)
      </p>
      <h4>Step #2</h4>
      <p>
        It will look for a matching route for this request, for example in the
        <b>/config/routes.yaml</b> file and will call the associated
        <b>controller</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Step #3</h4>
      <p>
        The controller that was called will send a response and display the
        corresponding template that it will fetch in the
        <b>/templates</b> directory
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Creating your first route</h2>
      <h3>#KeepItSimple</h3>
      <p>
        If you only render static pages (pages that will not need to display
        dynamic data) you won't even need to create your own
        <b>controller</b> as Symfony provides a <b>TemplateController</b> class
        that works out of the box
      </p>
      <p>
        All you have to do is add your route in the routes config file,
        associate the controller and specify the name of the template to render
        (that can be a html, php or twig file)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://symfony.com/doc/4.1/templating/render_without_controller.html"
          >More resources here</a
        >
      </p>
      <h3>#OneStepBeyond</h3>
      <p>
        One other way is to create your route and specify a custom controller
        and method (remember a controller is a php class that has properties and
        methods)
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look in <b>/config/routes.yaml</b> you will find and example here
      </p>
      <p>
        Next step is to create your <b>controller</b> and create inside it the
        specified method that will return a <b>Response</b> object containing
        the corresponding template (.html, .php, .twig)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://symfony.com/doc/4.1/page_creation.html#creating-a-page-route-and-controller"
          >More on this topic here</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example, you will note that there is an alternate way to
        configure routes. For that you will need to install another package via
        <b>composer</b>
      </p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <h3>#KeepItSimple : start basic and build on it</h3>
      <h3>
        #Remember : Symfony is built with PHP. That means that you can use all
        PHP methods in your PHP files. You might for example want to create an
        <b>includes</b> folder in your <b>/templates</b> directory to store your
        nav bar and include it in your page templates ;)
      </h3>
      <h3>
        #ClassesEveywhere : controllers are classes (group them under the
        APP\Controller namespace), repositories are classes, entities too and
        much more
      </h3>
